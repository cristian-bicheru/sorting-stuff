Messing around with sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms:

### Predictive Insertion Sort
-------------------------------------------------
Identical to insertion sort except it uses a basic algorithm to predict where to insert each value and sort from there. 

Best Case: O(x), Average: O(x^2) (experimental: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ctupjsgtv1), Worst O(x^2).

Notes: Faster than standard insertion sort.
